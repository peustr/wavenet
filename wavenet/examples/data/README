-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


OVERVIEW

This is a public domain speech dataset consisting of 13,100 short audio clips
of a single speaker reading passages from 7 non-fiction books. A transcription
is provided for each clip. Clips vary in length from 1 to 10 seconds and have
a total length of approximately 24 hours.

The texts were published between 1884 and 1964, and are in the public domain.
The audio was recorded in 2016-17 by the LibriVox project and is also in the
public domain.



FILE FORMAT

Metadata is provided in metadata.csv. This file consists of one record per
line, delimited by the pipe character (0x7c). The fields are:

  1. ID: this is the name of the corresponding .wav file
  2. Transcription: words spoken by the reader (UTF-8)
  3. Normalized Transcription: transcription with numbers, ordinals, and
     monetary units expanded into full words (UTF-8).

Each audio file is a single-channel 16-bit PCM WAV with a sample rate of
22050 Hz.

MISCELLANEOUS

The audio clips range in length from approximately 1 second to 10 seconds.
They were segmented automatically based on silences in the recording. Clip
boundaries generally align with sentence or clause boundaries, but not always.

The text was matched to the audio manually, and a QA pass was done to ensure
that the text accurately matched the words spoken in the audio.

The original LibriVox recordings were distributed as 128 kbps MP3 files. As a
result, they may contain artifacts introduced by the MP3 encoding.

The following abbreviations appear in the text. They may be expanded as
follows:
